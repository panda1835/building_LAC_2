This repo is where I store data files when conducting statistical analysis over a dataset of libral arts college, which is extracted from [usnews website](usnews.com).

The original idea of this research was to investigate various aspects of high education institution (e.g. tuition and fees, number of students/class, student faculty ratio, number of clubs, gender proposition ...). Our research subject focuses on American libral arts college. The final result will be used to inform the leadership and stakeholders of what important aspect that a new high education instution like Fulbright University Vietnam should consider and prioritize in the early years of its establishment. It is important to balance its identity as both American-education and for-Vietnam while maintains the coherence between traditional education approach and innovative teaching method.

This research is made in an effort of a group of 5 students and under supervision of Dr. Graeme Walker, professor of Economics, at Fulbright University Vietnam.
